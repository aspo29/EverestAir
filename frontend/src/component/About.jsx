              Everest Air, established in 1992 as Nepal Air Charter Services, provided both scheduled domestic flights and chartered helicopter services across Nepal. 
              Operating from its hub at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, Everest Air connected key destinations, including Pokhara, Biratnagar, and Jomsom. 
              Despite its growth, it ceased operations in 1998. Notable fleet included Dornier 228 aircraft, with some former operations utilizing Mil Mi-8 helicopters. 
              Everest Air was a prominent yet short-lived player in Nepalâ€™s aviation sector.
